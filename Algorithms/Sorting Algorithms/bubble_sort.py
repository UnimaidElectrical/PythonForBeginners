# Bubble Sort
# Bubble sort steps through the list and compares adjacent pairs of elements. 
# The elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order. 
# The pass through the unsorted portion of the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 
# Because Bubble sort repeatedly passes through the unsorted part of the list, it has a worst case complexity of O(nÂ²)
