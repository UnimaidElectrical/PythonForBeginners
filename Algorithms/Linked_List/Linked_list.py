******************************LINKED LIST******************************

There isnt a built-in data structure in Python that looks like a linked list. Thankfully, its easy to make classes that represent data structures 
in Python!

Heres the code for an Element, which will be a single unit in a linked list:

class Element(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
Make sure you understand this code before moving on! We use __init__ to initialize a new Element. An Element has some value associated with it 
(which could be anything—a number, a string, a character, et cetera), and it has a variable that points to the next element in the linked list.

Now, lets set up a LinkedList class:

class LinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head
This code is very similar—we are just establishing that a LinkedList is something that has a head Element, which is the first element in the list. 
If we establish a new LinkedList without a head, it will default to None.

Great! Lets add a method to our LinkedList to make it a little more useful. This method will add a new Element to the end of our LinkedList.

    def append(self, new_element):
        current = self.head
        if self.head:
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_element
        else:
            self.head = new_element
Again, this part is really important, so do not rush through it. Take the code line-by-line and make sure everything makes sense. 
If the LinkedList already has a head, iterate through the next reference in every Element until you reach the end of the list. 
Set next for the end of the list to be the new_element. Alternatively, if there is no head already, you should just assign new_element to it 
and do nothing else.



::::::::::::::::::::::::: Linked List Question  :::::::::::::::::::::::::

"""The LinkedList code from before is provided below.
Add three functions to the LinkedList.
"get_position" returns the element at a certain position.
The "insert" function will add an element to a particular
spot in the list.
"delete" will delete the first element with that
particular value.
Then, use "Test Run" and "Submit" to run the test cases
at the bottom."""

        self.value = value
        self.next = None

    def get_position(self, position):
        """Get an element from a particular position.
        Assume the first position is "1".
        Return "None" if position is not in the list."""
        return None
    
    def insert(self, new_element, position):
        """Insert a new node at the given position.
        Assume the first position is "1".
        Inserting at position 3 means between
        the 2nd and 3rd elements."""
        pass
    
    
    def delete(self, value):
        """Delete the first node with a given value."""
        pass

# Test cases
# Set up some Elements
e1 = Element(1)
e2 = Element(2)
e3 = Element(3)
e4 = Element(4)

# Start setting up a LinkedList
ll = LinkedList(e1)
ll.append(e2)
ll.append(e3)

# Test get_position
# Should print 3
print ll.head.next.next.value
# Should also print 3
print ll.get_position(3).value

# Test insert
ll.insert(e4,3)
# Should print 4 now
print ll.get_position(3).value

# Test delete
ll.delete(1)
# Should print 2 now
print ll.get_position(1).value
# Should print 4 now
print ll.get_position(2).value
# Should print 3 now
print ll.get_position(3).value
